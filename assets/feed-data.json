            "abstract":"Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials are ideal gas sensing materials with ultrahigh sensitivity due to the high surface-to-volume ratio, low electronic noise, and tunable Fermi level alignment. However, obtaining selectivity to a target analyte in the presence of other confounding gases in the environment remains an issue preventing selective gas sensing using 2D materials. In the present work, we fabricate a selective nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensor using WSe2 by adding a simple oil layer as a filter. For this proof of concept study, we used polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) due to its dipole moment being similar to NO2 (∼0.3 D). This PDMS layer helps selectively detect NO2 and filter out both more polar gases, such as ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), as well as nonpolar gases, such as carbon monoxide (CO), that are likely to be present in the background environment. Not only did we obtain a selective response for single components but also we observed an improved sensing response (around 200%) when NO2 is mixed with other gases compared to the intrinsic WSe2 device without modification. The obtained results were found to be reproducible and reversible. The charge transfer effect of different gases to WSe2 devices was characterized by an atomic force microscope (AFM) through phase imaging techniques.",
